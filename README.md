Deepfake Detection API
This project provides a Flask-based API for detecting deepfakes in video files. The system processes short 10-second video clips, detects whether they are real or fake, and returns the results in a JSON format. The deepfake detection model used in this API should be lightweight enough for efficient processing in real-time.

Features
Accepts video uploads via a POST request to the /detect_deepfake endpoint.
Processes 10-second video clips (300 frames) for deepfake detection.
Returns a JSON response indicating whether the video is a deepfake or not.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
OpenCV
PyTorch (or another framework used for deepfake detection)
A pre-trained deepfake detection model
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
2. If you're starting from scratch, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should include the following:

Copy code
Flask
opencv-python
torch
3. Place the Deepfake Detection Model
You need a pre-trained deepfake detection model. If you have a model, place it in the models/ directory or adjust the path in the code accordingly.

bash
Copy code
path_to_model_weights = "path_to_your_model_weights"
If you donâ€™t have a pre-trained model, you can train one or use a pre-built solution available in libraries like DeepFace or others for deepfake detection.

4. Run the Flask App
To start the server, run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

5. Test the API
You can now send a POST request to the /detect_deepfake endpoint with a video file. The server will process the video and return whether it is real or fake.

Example Request (Using cURL):
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "video=@path_to_video_file.mp4" http://127.0.0.1:5000/detect_deepfake
Example Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "is_deepfake": true
}
6. Deploying to Production
To deploy this API in a production environment, consider the following:

Use gunicorn or uWSGI for production-grade WSGI servers.
Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
Add API authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the service.
Enable HTTPS for secure communication.
Optimize the model for inference on the server (e.g., using TorchScript, ONNX, or TensorFlow Lite).
API Documentation
POST /detect_deepfake
Description: This endpoint accepts a video file upload and returns whether the video is a deepfake or not.

Request
Method: POST
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: A video file (e.g., video.mp4) under the video key.
Response
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
is_deepfake: A boolean indicating whether the video is a deepfake (true) or real (false).
Example Response
json
Copy code
{
  "is_deepfake": true
}
7. Troubleshooting
Error: "No video file provided": Ensure that you are uploading a file with the correct form field (video).
Error: "File is too large": The API may have size limits for video uploads. Check the max_content_length setting in Flask.
Error: Model loading issue: If the model path is incorrect or the model is not supported, ensure that the model is loaded correctly and the framework is compatible.
